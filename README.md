Flappy-Hexagon
==============

Flappy Hexagon is a game where you play as a polymorphic hexagon going through the various stages of his life

Controls
==============

Spacebar - Jump/Start/Restart

Music
==============

I removed the background music I originally had because I stole it from Super Hexagon. Add your own music to the game under Flappy Hexagon/Resources/music1.wav (name cannot be changed) before building.
